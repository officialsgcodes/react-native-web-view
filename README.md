# React Native WebView
This is a React Native WebView component. All the URLs that are openend in a React Native application are openeed in the browser. And becasue of hthis, the user navigatesout of the application and chances are that he/she might get distracted and not come back to the application. This is when the WebView comes into the picture. 
It allows us to open any URL within our applicatiobn only, and so now the user stays on the application which increases the user engagment time as well.
